This function extracts and interprets text and visual content from PDF files using a multimodal approach. Unlike traditional OCR, this function not only captures text but also provides detailed descriptions of images and charts within the PDF. The process begins by uploading the file to a Google Cloud Storage (GCP) bucket, which subsequently triggers a Cloud Function to initiate the extraction and interpretation process.
